I am currently a Research Scientist at the **[Data Science Institute](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/)** at **Columbia University**, where I lead the *Machine Learning for Data Assimilation* project within [**LEAP**](https://leap.columbia.edu/) — an NSF Science and Technology Center of *Learning the Earth with AI and Physics*.  I develop **physics-grounded, uncertainty-quantified models** that integrate turbulence theory with generative machine learning to predict how Earth’s surface and climate extremes evolve under intensifying human pressures. **Turbulence** is the unifying physical driver, governing particle transport, shaping natural morphodynamics, and controlling boundary layer processes that influence the intensity and persistence of heat waves. My goal is to connect small-scale turbulent energetics to basin- and regional-scale landscape evolution and climate risk mitigation. My research thus lies at the interface of:  **(i)** turbulence and hydrodynamics,  **(ii)** sediment geomorphology, and  **(iii)** generative machine learning.

At Columbia, I work with Professors [**Pierre Gentine**](https://leap.columbia.edu/) and [**Tian Zheng**](https://leap.columbia.edu/). Prior to joining Columbia, I earned a Ph.D. in **Fluid Dynamics** from **Duke University**, advised by Professor [**Gabriel Katul**](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/gaby), and an M.S. in **Computer Science**, working with Professor [**Vahid Tarokh**](https://ece.duke.edu/people/vahid-tarokh/) — both members of the **National Academy of Engineering**. Earlier in my academic career, I received graduate degrees in **Mechanical Engineering** at **Cornell University** and **Environmental Engineering** at **Northwestern University**.
