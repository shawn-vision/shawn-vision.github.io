This work introduced one of the first models for **sediment settling velocity** in turbulent flows using **perturbation analysis**.

Traditionally, settling velocity is assumed equal to still water, but my work shows turbulence **reduces** settling velocity via:
- **Basset history force**
- **Virtual mass effects**

This challenges assumptions used in **Rouse's equation** and explains discrepancies with **turbulent Schmidt number** formulations. The derived **comprehensive equation** includes **all turbulence scales**, from bulk flow to **Kolmogorov scale**, revealing:
- Scaling with **Reynolds number**
- Limits of local mixing-length models
- **Rouse equation** as a special case
