Channel vulnerability to **scour and deposition** remains a key engineering concern, especially under climate pressure. Existing models often lack direct links between **sediment physics** and **observations**.

My research derives a **universal prediction formula** starting from:
- **Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE)** equations
- **Shear stress budget**

This formulation spans **five orders of magnitude** of historic measurements and supports:
- Climate adaptation infrastructure
- Engineering of resilient scouring/deposition systems

The model bridges **microscale turbulence** and **bulk-scale sediment transport**, enabling more reliable and physically grounded sediment predictions.
