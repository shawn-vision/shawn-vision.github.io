A fundamental problem in fluid mechanics is explaining **energy dissipation in turbulent flows** due to friction at boundaries (wall friction). This issue has significant implications for the transport of oil and methane across continents.

Traditional analyses rely on empirical tools such as **Nikuradse/Moody diagrams** to describe friction factor as a function of **Reynolds number** and **relative roughness**. My work derives a **first-principles physical explanation** based on turbulence theory, unifying these diagrams into a **single curve** by using the turbulence energy spectrum.
