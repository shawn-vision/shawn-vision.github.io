This research examines how **boundary roughness** (e.g., vegetation) affects **flow structure** and bulk flow properties. 

- Developed an **asymmetric eddy diffusivity model** for vegetated flows.
- Derived a **universal velocity distribution equation** using asymptotic analysis.
- Applied numerical **reactive transport modeling** to quantify contaminant absorption by vegetation in floating treatment wetlands.

The study links **microscale physics** to **field-scale contaminant removal efficiency**, confirming results against empirical data.
