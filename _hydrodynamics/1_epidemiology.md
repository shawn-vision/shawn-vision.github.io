My study shows that even a small number of infected individuals who travel between communities — what we call “geographical spreaders” — can dramatically influence how a disease spreads. Using a mathematical model, we found that just 1–10% of mobile infected people can speed up the outbreak and create organized patterns like waves or hotspots in places far from the original source. 

These findings highlight that **movement** — how far and how often people travel — can be just as important as infection rates when it comes to understanding and controlling outbreaks. Even if most people stay put, a few movers can reshape the entire course of an epidemic.
