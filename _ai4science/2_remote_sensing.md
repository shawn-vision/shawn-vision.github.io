This research enhances climate forecasts by integrating **transport processes** into Earth System Models (ESMs). I utilize **indirect meteorological observations** — such as gas flux, vapor, and precipitation — via a **deep learning–based data assimilation framework** I designed.

Unlike traditional techniques bound by **linear/Gaussian assumptions**, my **multimodal framework** leverages **generative learning** to assimilate both **in-situ data** (e.g., CPC rain gauges) and **satellite remote sensing** (e.g., NOAA) under sparse, noisy conditions.

I further developed a **probabilistic data assimilation method** using **density-based modeling** for parameter inference and **Bayesian uncertainty quantification**, which is critical for **long-term projections** and for estimating the probability of major climate events like flooding and heat extremes.
