In machine learning weather assimilation, scientists use observations to adjust their models' trajectory and forecasts — like daily temperatures. This traditional method focuses on short-term accuracy. However, for **climate models**, it's essential to understand long-term dynamics and distributions, since we cannot replicate the exact future state of a single day.

This work proposes a new strategy to improve **data assimilation targeting statistical distributions**, looking beyond point forecasts to the broader range of likely states. It also introduces a **Bayesian framework** for **uncertainty-aware parameter inference**, enhancing projection reliability.

This approach enables better estimation of **extreme events** — like heatwaves or cold snaps — and analysis of their **joint quantile structures**.
