This work pioneers a **physics-informed ML framework** for modeling **suspended sediment transport** in vegetated flows. It enables data-driven closure of sediment dispersion fluxes, directly linking microscale turbulence to bulk sediment concentration in channel experiments.

Beyond sediment transport, I extend this approach to model **pier scour formation** using **machine learning–enhanced turbulence physics**. By unifying **TKE** and **shear stress budgets**, the model links **scour depth** to the dominant turbulent eddy scale — something previously inaccessible through traditional modeling.

Due to complexity, analytical solutions remain elusive. To overcome this, I apply **symbolic regression** to derive closed-form expressions linking **turbulent structures** with **geomorphic response** — opening new pathways for coupling **AI and physical sciences**.
